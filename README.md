## Description
Shields Up, RAMpage! is a high-octane, split-screen space adventure where you juggle two roles simultaneously in a single-player experience. On one side, you’re the daring pilot of a spaceship, dodging asteroids and evading hostile drones in deep space. On the other, you’re the ship’s engineer, racing between control rooms to repair critical systems and bring your shields online. Once those shields are up, it's time to go on the offensive—turning your ship into a battering ram to smash your enemies to pieces. Manage your resources, time your moves, and survive the onslaught in this thrilling blend of action, strategy, and split-second decision-making!

## Developer Notes:
This game is more of a tech demo than a full-fledged game demo. To say we bit off more than we can chew is an understatement. That being said, we're incredibly proud of what we've created. We wanted to ensure the two different scales were part of the same 'instance' and had major effects on the other.

You're looking at a single-player experience that requires playing two different characters (pilot and engineer) at the same time in the same world.  Due to the sheer difference in scale between the two views, we could not simply have the indoors sit on top of the zoomed ship view. In the end, we have 3 cameras. One for the left side of the screen, and two layers (zoomed ship and ship indoors) on the right. Pinning the inside of the ship to the zoomed view on the right side and still having the camera follow the engineer around was a big undertaking that I hope to expand upon in future projects.

When we began the jam we had one goal in mind: innovate. I believe we've done just that in spades.
